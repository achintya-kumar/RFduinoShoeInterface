# RFduino Shoe-Interface

## Development of an foot-based input device for the OR able to distinguish between locomotion and foot gestures
Foot-based Interaction in the OR enables control of computer system while keeping the hands free for more important tasks. Currently, foot-pedals or â€“rockers are used to trigger basic functionalities. However, by using an extended vocabulary the feet might be able to fulfill various tasks such as software control. This might be achieved with shoe-based sensors. A challenge for this kind of input devices is to distinguish between foot-based gestures and other movements related to locomotion or adjustment of the stance. To investigate this topic, a prototypical input device needs to be developed.
